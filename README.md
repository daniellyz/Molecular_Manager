# Molecular_Manager

Molecular_Manager is a data management system to lookup or query an environmental compound database by retention time, polarity or compound type. The database contains **compounds**: a database of identified compounds, and **measured_compounds**: their analytical data. Analytical data of an identified compound can be inserted into **measured_compounds** by all users. Only database administrator can add a structure-confirmed compound into **compounds**.

## Requirements:

* Docker software Windows/macOS: https://www.docker.com/
* Docker installation for Ubuntu:
  ```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install docker.io
  sudo systemctl enable --now docker
  ```
* Git (latest version)
  
## Installation:

Clone the software from Github to your local directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/daniellyz/Molecular_Manager.git
```

Make sure Docker is running on your machine and type:

```
docker image build -t molecular_manager .
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d molecular_manager
```

## Database lookup and query:

Please use software such as Postman to run the API interactively on your local machine.

To send a request to retrieve a list of **compounds**:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/compounds
```
To send a request to retrieve a list of **measured_compounds**:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/measured_compounds
```
To query **measured_compounds** based on *retention time*:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/measured_compounds/query?query_params=RT&value=18.3
```
To query **measured_compounds** based on *type*:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/measured_compounds/query?query_params=type&value=metabolites
```
To query **measured_compounds** without *type* specification:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/measured_compounds/query?query_params=type&value=Unknown
```
To query **measured_compounds** based on *polarity* (positive or negative):
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/measured_compounds/query?query_params=polarity&value=negative
```

## Database update:

You can add each time one **measured_compounds**. The data must be written in *json* format: 

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/measured_compounds/update
```

The compound *3360* is present in **compounds** database, its "M+H" adduct is added in **measured_compounds**: 
```
{
     "compound_id": "3360",
     "compound_name": "Darunavir-d9",
     "retention_time": "18",
     "retention_time_comment": "",
     "adduct_name": "M+H",
     "user": "yliu",
     "password": "555",
     "molecular_formula": "C27H29[2]H9N3O7S1",
     "type ": ""
}
```
The "M+FA-H" adduct is added for compound *3401*: 

```
{
      "compound_id": "3401",
      "compound_name": "Losartan-D4",
      "retention_time": "18.3",
      "retention_time_comment": "",
      "adduct_name": "M+FA-H",
      "user": "yliu",
      "password": "555",
      "molecular_formula": "C22H18[2]H4N6O1Cl1",
      "type ": ""
}
```

The "M+FA-H" adduct detected at another retention time is added for compound *3401*: 

```
{
      "compound_id": "3401",
      "compound_name": "Losartan-D4",
      "retention_time": "21.3",
      "retention_time_comment": "Isomer detected, different RT",
      "adduct_name": "M+FA-H",
      "user": "yliu",
      "password": "555",
      "molecular_formula": "",
      "type ": ""
}
```
No update will be made for **measured_compounds** since compound *3401* is already measured with the same retention and same adduct:
```
{
      "compound_id": "3401",
      "compound_name": "Losartan-D4",
      "retention_time": "18.3",
      "retention_time_comment": "",
      "adduct_name": "M-H",
      "user": "yliu",
      "password": "555",
      "molecular_formula": "",
      "type ": ""
}
```
When database administrator (with correct user name and password) confirms a new structure, she/he can assign it a new compound id "50000",  both **compounds** and **measured_compounds** will be updated:

```
{
     "compound_id": "50000",
     "compound_name": "NADPH",
     "retention_time": "15",
     "retention_time_comment": "bad peak shape",
     "adduct_name": "M+H",
     "user": "Admin",
     "password": "1111",
     "molecular_formula": "C21H30N7O17P3Â ",
     "type": "metabolites"
}
```
Afterwards, any user can add extra analytical data of "50000" in the **measured_compounds**:
```
{
      "compound_id": "50000",
      "compound_name": "NADPH",
      "retention_time": "16",
      "retention_time_comment": "Isomer detected, different RT",
      "adduct_name": "M+Na",
      "user": "yliu",
      "password": "555",
      "molecular_formula": "",
      "type": "metabolites"
}
```

The added data record will be displayed as a *json* file with computed **ion formula** and **ion mass**:

```
{
     "Added": "",
     "Adduct ID": 2,
     "Compound ID": 50000,
     "Ion formula": "C21H30N7NaO17P3",
     "Ion mass": 768.0803,
     "Measured Compound ID": 1605,
     "Retention Time ID": "C50000:RT16.0"
}
```

You can delete all added data records by:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/measured_compounds/delete
```

## Stop the software:

You will be able to see currently running docker containers using below command.

```
docker ps
```

Then copy the CONTAINER ID of the running container and execute the following command

```
docker stop <container_id>
```
